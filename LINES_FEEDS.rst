GTFS Realtime Processing
========================

The OneBusAway tools are open source, so we should
be able to learn from their GTFS processing code (Java) and docs:
https://github.com/OneBusAway
https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/Real-Time-Data-Configuration-Guide
https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway/wiki/GTFS-Realtime-Resources

Could be amusing to plot the location of buses over the DC region using Cesium.
